== Issue 1:
Provider libvirt not found 
[source, bash]
----
$ vagrant up                                                                                                                                                                                                   
The provider 'libvirt' could not be found, but was requested to
back the machine 'master'. Please use a provider that exists.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Vagrant knows about the following providers: docker, hyperv, virtualbox

----

== Solution:
Make sure that we have ruby-dev or ruby-devel and then install libvirt plugin
[source, bash]
----
$ yum install ruby-devel
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt
$ vagrant plugin list 
vagrant-libvirt (0.0.45, global)
